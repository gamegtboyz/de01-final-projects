We gathered this information from the following link:
    https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95/about_data

Then use the code as shown in python script to fetch the data. Then, upload onto .csv files for further analysis.

The questions we primarily asked from the dataset are:
1. What are the most common cause (a.k.a contributing factor) for vehicle collision.
2. Which type of vehicle are most common in collisions.
3. Where are the most frequent collision site.
4. Which type of vehicle cause the most casualities/fatalities rate (person per 1000 collisions)
5. Is the time of the day (daytime/nighttime) associated with collision frequencies.
