This is guide how to install Apache Airflow using Docker.
1. Download Docker Desktop.
2. Go to settings, enable WSL engine.
3. Let Docker run at this point.
4. Open your VScode. Direct to your working directory, then open the WSL terminal, and use the following command
    - curl -LfO 'https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.10.4/docker-compose.yaml'
    - mkdir -p ./dags ./logs ./plugins
    - echo -e "AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)" > .env
    - docker-compose up airflow-init
    - docker-compose up
    * at this point, you could access the webUI of Airflow using localhost:8080 (or other ports, as defined in .yaml file) using username == airflow, and password == airflow
    * the current terminal will keep itself running, so further process with terminal, we should open the new terminal instead.
6. To create new users, please open the new termianal, as explained. then use the following bash command to create the new users
    - docker exec -it <webserver-container-name> bash
    - airflow users create \
    > --username <username> \
    > --firstname <firstname> \
    > --lastname <lastname> \
    > --role Admin \
    > --email <email> \
    > --password <password>
